### Caching in Glide

By default, Glide checks multiple layers of caches before starting a new request for an image:

1. Active resources - Is this image displayed in another View right now?
2. Memory cache - Was this image recently loaded and still in memory?
3. Resource - Has this image been decoded, transformed, and written to the disk cache before?
4. Data - Was the data this image was obtained from written to the disk cache before?

The first two steps check to see if the resource is in memory and if so, return the image immediately. The second two steps check to see if the image is on disk and return quickly, but asynchronously.

If all four steps fail to find the image, then Glide will go back to the original source to retrieve the data (the origial File, Uri, Url etc).

### Cache Keys

In Glide 4, all cache keys contain at least two elements:

1. The model the load is requested for (File, Uri, Url)
2. An optional [``Signature``][1]

In fact, the cache keys for steps 1-3 (Active resources, memory cache, resource disk cache) also include a number of other pieces of data including:

1. The width and height 
2. The optional ``Transformation``
3. Any added [``Options``][2]
4. The requested data type (Bitmap, GIF, etc)

The keys used for active resources and the memory cache also differ slightly from those used from the resource disk cache to accomodate in memory [``Options``][2] like those thataffect the configuration of the Bitmap or other decode time only parameters.

To generate the name of disk cache keys on disk, the individual elements of the keys are hashed to create a single String key, which is then used as the file name in the disk cache.

### Cache Invalidation
Because disk cache are hashed keys, there is no good way to simply delete all of the cached files on disk that correspond to a particular url or file path. The problem would be simpler if you were only ever allowed to load or cache the original image, but since Glide also caches thumbnails and provides various transformations, each of which will result in a new File in the cache, tracking down and deleting every cached version of an image is difficult.

In practice, the best way to invalidate a cache file is to change your identifier when the content changes (url, uri, file path etc) when possible.

#### Custom Cache Invalidation
Since it's often difficult or impossible to change identifiers, Glide also offers the [``signature()``][1] API to mix in additional data that you control into your cache key. Signatures work well for media store content, as well as any content you can maintain some versioning metadata for.

* Media store content - For media store content, you can use Glide's [``MediaStoreSignature``][3] class as your signature. ``MediaStoreSignature`` allows you to mix the date modified time, mime type, and orientation of a media store item into the cache key. These three attributes reliably catch edits and updates allowing you to cache media store thumbs.
* Files - You can use [``ObjectKey``][4] to mix in the File's date modified time.
* Urls - Although the best way to invalidate urls is to make sure the server changes the url and updates the client when the content at the url changes, you can also use [``ObjectKey``][4] to mix in arbitrary metadata (such as a version number) instead.

Passing in signatures to loads is simple:

```java
Glide.with(yourFragment)
    .load(yourFileDataModel)
    .signature(new ObjectKey(yourVersionMetadata))
    .into(yourImageView);
```

The media store signature is also straightforward data from the MediaStore:
```java
Glide.with(fragment)
    .load(mediaStoreUri)
    .signature(new MediaStoreSignature(mimeType, dateModified, orientation))
    .into(view);
```

You can also define your own signature by implementing the [``Key``][5] interface. Be sure to implement ``equals()``, ``hashCode()`` and the ``updateDiskCacheKey()`` method:

```java
public class IntegerVersionSignature implements Key {
    private int currentVersion;

    public IntegerVersionSignature(int currentVersion) {
         this.currentVersion = currentVersion;
    }
   
    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (o instanceof IntegerVersionSignature) {
            IntegerVersionSignature other = (IntegerVersionSignature) o;
            return currentVersion = other.currentVersion;
        }
        return false;
    }
 
    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return currentVersion;
    }

    @Override
    public void updateDiskCacheKey(MessageDigest md) {
        messageDigest.update(ByteBuffer.allocate(Integer.SIZE).putInt(signature).array());
    }
}
```

Keep in mind that to avoid degrading performance, you will want to batch load any versioning metadata in the background so that it is available when you want to load your image.

If all else fails and you can neither change your identifier nor keep track of any reasonable version metadata, you can also disable disk caching entirely using [``diskCacheStrategy()``][6] and [``DiskCacheStrategy.NONE``][7].
